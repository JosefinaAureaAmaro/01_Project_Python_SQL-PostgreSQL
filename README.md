# Team 18 
Team 18 Proposal (Greyson & Josefina):

We plan on using 3 data sources from Fec.Gov. We will be extracting data from CSVs (Contributions to Candidates from Individuals, Contributions to Candidates from Committees , and Expenditures by Candidate) cleaning it up, and loading it into a PostgreSQL database.


Our hope is that this resulting database can be used for quickly finding and visualizing information about the (a) sources of funds raised and (b) recipients of payments by each major party candidate in the 2016 election and how it varies by candidate.
